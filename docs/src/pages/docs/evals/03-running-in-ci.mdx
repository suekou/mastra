# Running Evals in CI

Running evals in your CI pipeline helps bridge this gap by providing quantifiable metrics for measuring agent quality over time.

## Setting Up CI Integration

We support any testing framework that supports ESM modules. For example, you can use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run evals in your CI/CD pipeline.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.test.ts"
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { evaluate } from "@mastra/evals";
import { ToneConsistencyMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";
import { myAgent } from './index';

describe('My Agent', () => {
  it('should validate tone consistency', async () => {
    const metric = new ToneConsistencyMetric();
    const result = await evaluate(myAgent, 'Hello, world!', metric)

    expect(result.score).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

You will need to configure a testSetup and globalSetup script for your testing framework to capture the eval results. It allows us to show these results in your mastra dashboard.

## Framework Configuration

### Vitest Setup

Add these files to your project to run evals in your CI/CD pipeline:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="globalSetup.ts"
import { globalSetup } from '@mastra/evals';

export default function setup() {
  globalSetup()
}
```

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="testSetup.ts"
import { beforeAll } from 'vitest';
import { attachListeners } from '@mastra/evals';

beforeAll(async () => {
  await attachListeners();
});
```

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="vitest.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globalSetup: './globalSetup.ts',
    setupFiles: ['./testSetup.ts'],
  },
})
```

## Storage Configuration

To store eval results in Mastra Storage and capture results in the Mastra dashboard:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="testSetup.ts"
import { beforeAll } from 'vitest';
import { attachListeners } from '@mastra/evals';
import { mastra } from './your-mastra-setup';

beforeAll(async () => {
  // Store evals in Mastra Storage (requires storage to be enabled)
  await attachListeners(mastra);
});
```

With file storage, evals persist and can be queried later. With memory storage, evals are isolated to the test process.
