# Workflow Class

The Workflow class enables you to create state machines for complex sequences of operations with conditional branching and data validation.

```ts copy
import { Workflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";

const workflow = new Workflow({ name: "my-workflow" });
```

## API Reference

### Constructor

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description: "Identifier for the workflow",
    },
    {
      name: "logger",
      type: "Logger<WorkflowLogMessage>",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "Optional logger instance for workflow execution details",
    },
    {
      name: "steps",
      type: "Step[]",
      description: "Array of steps to include in the workflow",
    },
    {
      name: "triggerSchema",
      type: "z.Schema",
      description: "Optional schema for validating workflow trigger data",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Core Methods

#### `step()`

Adds a [Step](./step-class.mdx) to the workflow, including transitions to other steps. Returns the workflow instance for chaining. [Learn more about steps](./step-class.mdx).

#### `commit()`

Validates and finalizes the workflow configuration. Must be called after adding all steps.

#### `execute()`

Executes the workflow with optional trigger data. Typed based on the [trigger schema](./workflow.mdx#trigger-schemas).

## Trigger Schemas

Trigger schemas validate the initial data passed to a workflow using Zod.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const workflow = new Workflow({
  name: "order-process",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    orderId: z.string(),
    customer: z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      email: z.string().email(),
    }),
  }),
});
```

The schema:

- Validates data passed to `execute()`
- Provides TypeScript types for your workflow input

## Validation

Workflow validation happens at two key times:

### 1. At Commit Time

When you call `.commit()`, the workflow validates:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
workflow
  .step('step1', {...})
  .step('step2', {...})
  .commit(); // Validates workflow structure
```

- Circular dependencies between steps
- Terminal paths (every path must end)
- Unreachable steps
- Variable references to non-existent steps
- Duplicate step IDs

### 2. During Execution

When you call `start()`, it validates:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const { runId, start } = workflow.createRun();

// Validates trigger data against schema
await start({
  triggerData: {
    orderId: "123",
    customer: {
      id: "cust_123",
      email: "invalid-email", // Will fail validation
    },
  },
});
```

- Trigger data against trigger schema
- Each step's input data against its inputSchema
- Variable paths exist in referenced step outputs
- Required variables are present

## Workflow Status

A workflow's status indicates its current execution state. The possible values are:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "CREATED",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow instance has been created but not started"
    },
    {
      name: "RUNNING",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow is actively executing steps"
    },
    {
      name: "SUSPENDED",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow execution is paused waiting for resume"
    },
    {
      name: "COMPLETED",
      type: "string",
      description: "All steps finished executing successfully"
    },
    {
      name: "FAILED",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow encountered an error during execution"
    }
  ]}
/>

### Example: Handling Different Statuses

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const { runId, start, watch } = workflow.createRun();

watch(async ({ status }) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "SUSPENDED":
      // Handle suspended state
      break;
    case "COMPLETED":
      // Process results
      break;
    case "FAILED":
      // Handle error state
      break;
  }
});

await start({ triggerData: data });
```

## Error Handling

```ts showLineNumbers copy
try {
  const { runId, start, watch, resume } = workflow.createRun();
  await start({ triggerData: data });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Handle validation errors
    console.log(error.type); // 'circular_dependency' | 'no_terminal_path' | 'unreachable_step'
    console.log(error.details); // { stepId?: string, path?: string[] }
  }
}
```

## Passing Context Between Steps

Steps can access data from previous steps in the workflow through the context object. Each step receives the accumulated context from all previous steps that have executed.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
workflow
  .step({
    id: 'getData',
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      return {
        data: { id: '123', value: 'example' }
      };
    }
  })
  .step({
    id: 'processData',
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Access data from previous step through context.steps
      const previousData = context.steps.getData.output.data;
      // Process previousData.id and previousData.value
    }
  });
```

The context object:
- Contains results from all completed steps in `context.steps`
- Provides access to step outputs through `context.steps.[stepId].output`
- Is typed based on step output schemas
- Is immutable to ensure data consistency
