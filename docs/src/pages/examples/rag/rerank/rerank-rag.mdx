# Re-ranking Results with Tools

This example demonstrates how to use Mastra's vector query tool to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with re-ranking using OpenAI embeddings and PGVector for vector storage.

## Overview

The system implements RAG with re-ranking using Mastra and OpenAI. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Mastra agent with gpt-4o-mini for response generation
2. Creates a vector query tool with re-ranking capabilities
3. Chunks text documents into smaller segments and creates embeddings from them
4. Stores them in a PostgreSQL vector database
5. Retrieves and re-ranks relevant chunks based on queries
6. Generates context-aware responses using the Mastra agent

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Then, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { MDocument, createVectorQueryTool } from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";
```

## Vector Query Tool Creation with Re-ranking

Using createVectorQueryTool imported from @mastra/rag, you can create a tool that can query the vector database and re-rank results:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="index.ts"
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  reranker: {
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  },
});
```

## Agent Configuration

Set up the Mastra agent that will handle the responses:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{17} filename="index.ts"
export const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "RAG Agent",
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context. Keep your answers concise and relevant.
    Important: When asked to answer a question, please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. 
    If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    vectorQueryTool,
  },
});
```

## Instantiate PgVector and Mastra

Instantiate PgVector and Mastra with the components:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{29} filename="index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector(process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!);

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { ragAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});
const agent = mastra.getAgent("ragAgent");
```

## Document Processing

Create a document and process it into chunks:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{38} filename="index.ts"
const doc1 = MDocument.fromText(`
market data shows price resistance levels.
technical charts display moving averages.
support levels guide trading decisions.
breakout patterns signal entry points.
price action determines trade timing.

baseball cards show gradual value increase.
rookie cards command premium prices.
card condition affects resale value.
authentication prevents fake trading.
grading services verify card quality.

volume analysis confirms price trends.
sports cards track seasonal demand.
chart patterns predict movements.
mint condition doubles card worth.
resistance breaks trigger orders.
rare cards appreciate yearly.
`);

const chunks = await doc1.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 150,
  overlap: 20,
  separator: "\n",
});
```

## Creating and Storing Embeddings

Generate embeddings for the chunks and store them in the vector database:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{66} filename="index.ts"
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map(chunk => chunk.text),
});

const vectorStore = mastra.getVector("pgVector");
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});

await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});
```

## Querying with Re-ranking

Try different queries to see how the re-ranking affects results:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{82} filename="index.ts"
const queryOne = 'explain technical trading analysis';
const answerOne = await agent.generate(queryOne);
console.log('\nQuery:', queryOne);
console.log('Response:', answerOne.text);

const queryTwo = 'explain trading card valuation';
const answerTwo = await agent.generate(queryTwo);
console.log('\nQuery:', queryTwo);
console.log('Response:', answerTwo.text);

const queryThree = 'how do you analyze market resistance';
const answerThree = await agent.generate(queryThree);
console.log('\nQuery:', queryThree);
console.log('Response:', answerThree.text);
```
